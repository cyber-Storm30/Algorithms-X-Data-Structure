In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted Fn form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is,

F_0=0,   F_1=1,

and

F_n=F_{n-1}+F_{n-2}, F_n=F_{n-1}+F_{n-2},
for n > 1.

One has F_2 = 1. In some books, and particularly in old ones, F_0, the "0" is omitted, and the Fibonacci sequence starts with F1 = F2 = 1. 

The beginning of the sequence is thus:

`0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 ...`
