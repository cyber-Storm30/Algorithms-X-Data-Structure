"""
The knapsack problem or rucksack problem is a problem in combinatorial optimization: Given a set of items,
each with a weight and a value, determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total
weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible. It derives its name
from the problem faced by someone who is constrained by a fixed-size knapsack and must fill it with the most
valuable items.
