# Using Kadane's Algorithm for solving maximum sub-array problem.

## Example #1

    Input  -> [-1, 2, 3, -2]
    Output -> [2, 3]

As maximum possible sum of sub-array is 5, 
where the sub-array is `[2, 3]`

## Example #2:
    Input  -> [3, 5, -1, 8, -2, -4]
    Output -> [3, 5, -1, 8]

As maximum possible sum of sub-array is 15,
where the sub-array is `[3, 5, -1, 8]`
